Your technology stack is the collection of programming languages, frameworks, and other technologies that power your online store. Your technology stack can be broken down into two main categories: front end and back end.

The client-side or front end is the part of your website that is visible to the public. It's the interface customers see when they visit your online store. The main components you’ll use to shape and design the look of your website are HTML, CSS, and JS.

* **Hypertext markup language (HTML)** is what gives a web page its structure, and tells the browser how to read the different elements on the page including headings, lists, links, images, and so on.
* **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** is what you use to style and position the individual elements on your page including shape, size, color, and fonts. This also is how you build the layout of your website.

  * CSS frameworks provide predefined web elements that allow you to build elegant and responsive websites faster and more efficiently. Some popular CSS frameworks include Bootstrap, Foundation, and Materialize.
* **JavaScript (JS)** is what makes your website interactive. Beyond interactivity, JavaScript also provides real-time data updates and animation options. Javascript comes with frameworks and libraries that allow you to perform tasks in a less verbose way.

  * Popular frameworks include: Angular, Vue.js, Node.js,
  * Popular libraries include: jQuery and React.js

While the back end isn’t visible to end-users the same way the front end is, it’s equally as important – after all, these are the technologies powering your front end. The back end allows developers to store and access data, as well as create complex business logic making your website dynamic. Three major components of your back end are server-side programming language, server, and database.

When it comes to choosing a server-side programming language for your project, there are many factors to take into consideration, including developer availability, average cost of talent, scalability, and performance.

Popular programming languages and frameworks include:\
**PHP**: Laravel, Symfony, Phalcon, Slim\
**Ruby**: Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Padrino\
**Python**: Django, Flask, Pylons

You’ll need a way to store data – that’s where your database comes into play. Common databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB, and Firebase Database.

Lastly, you’ll need a server to handle requests from clients. Some popular options include Apache and Nginx.
